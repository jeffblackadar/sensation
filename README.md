# sensation
This is work for Heritage Jam 2021 and explores mapping work I have been doing as part of the CCAD-CRANE project.

## Requirements
This project will create an html page with a Leaflet map that is designed to run on a smartphone and plot the user's location.
To create the map and test it, you require:
* A computer to run a Python Jupyter Notebook (such as Google Colab)

To run the map on a phone you will need:
* A web server with TLS to serve up the map webpage using https.
* A smart phone


## setup / installation
These instructions use Google Drive and Google Colaboratory

1. In Google Drive - create a directory example: "github"
2. Open this notebook Google Colaboratory and follow the steps:  https://github.com/jeffblackadar/sensation/blob/main/installer.ipynb
3. Go back into Google Drive, select /github/sensation/sensory_map_generator.ipynb and Open in Google Colab
