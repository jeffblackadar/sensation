# sensation
This is work for Heritage Jam 2021 and explores mapping work I have been doing as part of the CCAD-CRANE project.

Here is a sample of the end result, an interative walking map. See: https://jeffblackadar.ca/sensation/test_map.html.

You can drag the ugly computer marker ![computer test icon](https://jeffblackadar.ca/sensation/icons/computer.png "computer test icon") around the map to test it. But walking the map in your neighbourhood is more fun. See below to make your own!

## Requirements
This project will create an html page with a Leaflet map that is designed to run on a smartphone and plot the user's location.
To create the map and test it, you require:
* A computer to run a Python Jupyter notebook (such as Google Colab)

To run the map on a phone you will need:
* A web server with TLS to serve up the map webpage using https.
* A smart phone

## setup / installation
These instructions use Google Drive and Google Colaboratory

1. In Google Drive - create a directory example: "github"
2. Open this notebook Google Colaboratory and follow the steps:  https://github.com/jeffblackadar/sensation/blob/main/installer.ipynb
3. Go back into Google Drive, select /github/sensation/sensory_map_generator.ipynb and Open in Google Colab
